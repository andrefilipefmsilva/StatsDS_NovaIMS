# StatsDS_NovaIMS

Project for the Statistics for Data Science course of the Master's in Data Science and Advance Analytics at Nova IMS.

The objective was to pick a dataset, and perform simple OLS regression analysis on it.
It is not my best work, and it is indeed very simple. However, this was what was asked of us, no more, no less.
